dvralarm installation
---------------------
ffmpeg and local SMTP server is currently a pre-requisite and must be installed for dvralarm to function

To install dvralarm run the following commands
-----------------------------------------------

$ make
$ sudo make install

ensure that the script is properly configured before starting the daemon. In particular ensure the 
zmodopipe configuration with IP, username, password and SMTP variables is properly setup. The installation process will now run an initial configuration wizard. Thereafter configuration can be changed directly in the config file using
$ sudo vim /etc/dvralarm/config.json

once installed, dvralarm will be run as a system service and can be controlled with
$ sudo /etc/init.d/dvralarm.sh start|stop|status

in daemon mode dvralarm will output log data to the logfile by default located at /var/log/dvralarm.log

to trigger an alarm event GPIO PIN 23 (Header PIN 16) must be connected to pull up resistor en triggered 
on falling edge by bridging to Ground ie. Header PIN 14

Reference the development board schematic included in this package for a GPIO wiring example with pull-up resistors.
